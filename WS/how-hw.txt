1. Forgot password:
    - POST method with body: email
        - check email in DB
    - if Yes:
    - make reset-hash with email as payload called "link"
    - write reset-hash in DB -> to user with email: email
    - send a mail to 'email' with EXAMPLE /api/v1/auth/forgot-password?info="link"
    - the link sent to the user would be a GET method... so the info needs to be in query
    =>??? (STEP2)
    - find in DB by reset-hash
    - POST method with token and new password [OR email,password and token as payload | check mail again]
    - delete or expire reset-hash
